subtitle: A Free Tool for Testing Accessibility with Extensive Results
---

As a project of my consulting business, Access Success LLC, I have developed TestPage, a free, open-source and cross-platform tool for testing web pages against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). The software provides a convenient and efficient method of conducting automated testing by anyone comfortable with the command line, either on Windows or MacOS.

Key features of TestPage include:

- Testing done by specifying either a single URL, or multiple URLs listed in a text file, enabling many pages to be tested in a single, unattended execution of the program.

- Test results stored in a new directory with a meaningful and unique file name, so the results can easily be recognized, and they are saved without risk of being replaced by subsequent results.

- Results output in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, HTML, and XLSX), and source files also saved (the HTML content, screenshot, and accessibility tree of the page).

- Use of a high quality API in the field: IBM Accessibility Checker.

Note that manual testing is also needed for evaluating web accessibility.

The TestPage project is available on the web at \
